# Tea-shop-project
---
It is a fictional tea shop website project for **CodeCademy**.

A design spec are being provided and image assets to help along the way. 

A design spec is an image of a web page outlined with all of its CSS properties and values. These are usually created by a designer as a source of instructions for a web developer. This project assumes that we will be able to write HTML and CSS from scratch.

The images and design spec needed to complete the project are listed as follow and are in Pics folder:

1. ![alt Logo] (img-tea-cozy-logo.png) 
2. ![alt Bedford Bizzarre] (img-bedford-bizarre.jpg)
